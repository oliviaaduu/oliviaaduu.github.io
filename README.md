# Hello!

This is my personal website. Built May 2022.

This is a personal project built during my summer break for me to learn and practice web dev (mainly React), experiment with creative styles, and reflect on my experiences and aspirations. Of course, it's also a perfect platform for introducing myself to new people! Building this project has been a journey in demonstrating my own capabilities to myself and celebrating my achievements.

I hope you learn a lot about who I am, and stick around in my life!
